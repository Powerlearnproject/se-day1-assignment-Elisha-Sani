_**Improves Quality**_: Enhances the quality of software ensuring software reliability.
_**Enhances Efficiency**_: Increases or enhances efficiency and productivity by streamlining day to day tasks.


**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
_**1. Inception of High-Level Programming Languages(1950s-1960s)**_: The development of programming languages such as Fortran, Lisp and COBOL allowed programmers to write code in a more human-readable language thus making software development more accessible and thus increasing productivity.
_**2. Introduction of Structured Programming(1960s-1970s)**_: Introductions of structured programming paradigm emphasized the use of control structures such as loops and conditionals which in turn improved code readability, maintainability and reliability. Languages such as C and Pascal emphasized this.
_**3. Agile Manifesto (2001)**_: This formalized a set of principles for iterative, collaborative, and flexible software development which led to the transformation of how software projects are managed and delivered.


**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
_**1. Planning**_: You define the project scope, objectives, and resources required. Create a project plan and timeline.
_**2. Requirements Analysis**_: Gathering and documenting functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.
_**3. Design**_: Creating architectural and detailed design documents. Define system components, interfaces, and data models.
_**4. Implementation**_: Writing the actual code based on the design specifications using appropriate programming languages and tools.
_**5. Testing**_: Performing various testing methods (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing) to ensure the software meets requirements and is free of defects.
_**6. Deployment**_: Releasing the software to the production environment. Configuring the software and ensuring it runs smoothly.
_**7. Maintenance**_: Continuously support, update, and improve the software to fix bugs, add new features, and adapt to changing user needs.


**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
_**Waterfall:**_
Sequential: Follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
Predictable: Well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes.
Documentation: Emphasizes thorough documentation at each phase.
Example: Developing software for regulated industries (e.g., medical devices) where requirements are fixed and well-documented.

_**Agile:**_
Iterative: Involves iterative cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback and improvement.
Flexible: Adapts to changing requirements and allows for frequent adjustments.
Collaboration: Encourages close collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
Example: Developing consumer-facing applications where requirements may change based on user feedback and market conditions.


**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
_**1. Software Developer:**_
Writing Code: Develops and implements software applications based on design specifications.
Debugging: Identifies and fixes defects in the code.
Collaborating: Works with other developers, designers, and product managers to create high-quality software.
Documentation: Writes and maintains documentation for the software code and functionalities.
Continuous Improvement: Stays updated with the latest technologies, frameworks, and development best practices.

_**2. Quality Assurance Engineer:**_
Test Planning: Develops the test plans and test cases to ensure software quality.
Executing Tests: Performs manual and automated testing to identify defects and ensures the software meets requirements.
Reporting Bugs: Documents and reports defects to the development team for resolution.
Verification: Verifies bug fixes and ensures issues are resolved before software release.
Quality Metrics: Tracks and analyzes quality metrics to improve software quality and testing processes.

_**3. Project Manager:**_
Project Planning: Defines the project scope, objectives, and deliverables. Create project schedules and allocate resources.
Team Coordination: Manages and coordinates the efforts of the development, QA, and design teams.
Communication: Acts as a liaison between stakeholders, including clients, team members, and management. Ensure clear and effective communication throughout the project.
Risk Management: Identifies potential risks and develops mitigation strategies.
Monitoring and Control: Tracks project progress, manages timelines, and ensures the project stays on schedule and within budget.
Reporting: Provides regular updates and reports to stakeholders on project status, milestones, and potential issues.


**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
_**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):**_
Efficiency: IDEs combine various tools and features, such as code editors, debuggers, and compilers, into a single application hence streamlining the development process and increasing productivity.
Error Reduction: IDEs provide real-time syntax highlighting, error detection, and code completion, which help developers identify and fix errors quickly.
Ease of Use: IDEs often come with user-friendly interfaces that simplify complex tasks, such as refactoring code or managing project files.
Examples:
Visual Studio Code
IntelliJ IDEA

_**Version Control Systems (VCS):**_
Collaboration: VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It tracks changes and merges updates efficiently.
History Tracking: VCS maintains a complete history of all changes made to the codebase. Developers can revert to previous versions if needed and understand the evolution of the project.
Backup and Recovery: VCS provides a backup of the codebase, ensuring that no work is lost, and facilitating recovery in case of accidental deletions or corruption.
Examples:
Git
Subversion (SVN)


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
1. Keeping Up with Technology Advancements: continuously learning and adapting by following industry trends and attending conferences.
2. Time Management and Meeting Deadlines: Use of project management tools to plan and track progress. Also setting realistic goals and breaking down of tasks into smaller and achievable milestones.
3. Debugging and Fixing Bugs: Writing clear and maintainable code, following the coding best practices, implementing thorough testing practices and use of reliable debugging tools.
   

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
_**Unit Testing**_: Tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
Importance: Ensures that each part of the software works as intended. Helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process.

_**Integration Testing**_: Tests the interaction between different components or modules of the software.
Importance: Ensures that integrated parts of the software work together correctly. Detects issues related to data flow, interfaces, and dependencies.

_**System Testing**_: Tests the entire software system as a whole.
Importance: Validates the software against the specified requirements. Ensures that the software functions correctly in its entirety and meets user expectations.

_**Acceptance Testing**_: Tests the software from the end-user's perspective.
Importance: Ensures that the software meets the user's needs and requirements. Provides confidence that the software is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively interact with AI models and obtain the desired output.
Importance: Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the AI's responses. Prompt engineering helps guide the AI to produce accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate outputs.


**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
_**Vague Prompt**_: "Help with cooking."
_**Improved Prompt**_: "Provide a step-by-step recipe for making Chapati, including the ingredients, preparation method, and cooking time."
_**Explanation**_: The improved prompt specifies the dish (In our case, chapati) and asks for detailed instructions (ingredients, preparation method, and cooking time), making it clear and actionable.
